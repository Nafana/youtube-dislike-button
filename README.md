# YouTube Dislike Button

A simple Chrome and Firefox extension with a backend for retrieving the dislike count on YouTube videos. YouTube has not removed the dislike count from being returned from their API endpoints, and this extension makes use of that.

### Running Extension Locally

> This extension is currently pending approval in the Chrome Web Store as well as Firefox AMO, however, you can have it running locally in under a minute.

Running the extension locally is simple.
- First, download the source code for the browser you want to install the extension on (from the releases tab).

### For Chrome ...

- Unzip the file to a location you like.
- Access the Chrome extension dashboard by typing the following into your Chrome search bar: **chrome://extensions/**
- In the top right-hand corner click the **Developer mode** switch to toggle it on.
- In the top left-hand corner press the **Load unpacked** button, and open the folder you unzipped

### For Firefox ...

> Note: Running debug add-ons on firefox persist only for the duration of the browser session. Waiting for the official add-on is recommended.

Navigate to the Firefox add-ons tab
- Menu > Add-ons and Themes > Settings Icon (Top Right) > Debug add-ons > Load Temporary Add-on
- Choose the zip file you downloaded
